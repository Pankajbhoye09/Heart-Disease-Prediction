# Heart-Disease-Prediction

This project demonstrates how to predict heart disease using a Logistic Regression model.

Project Goal: To predict the likelihood of heart disease based on a set of diagnostic features.

Approach:

Data Preparation and Feature Engineering:

Load heart disease data.
Prepare the data for supervised learning.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training and Prediction:

Train a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
Make predictions on the test data.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy.
How to Run:

Install the required libraries:

Bash

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn 
Prepare the data:

Ensure your heart disease data is in a CSV file named data.csv.
Run the code:

Bash

python heart_disease_prediction.py
